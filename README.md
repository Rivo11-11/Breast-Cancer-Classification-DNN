## Data Acquisition and Exploration

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer dataset from the `sklearn.datasets` library. This dataset comprises features computed from breast cancer cell nuclei, and the goal is to classify the tumors as either malignant or benign.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we prepare the data for model building by:

- Selecting relevant features
- Handling outliers
- Scaling features for better model performance

## Model Building

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is utilized for classification in this project. The model architecture includes:

- Input layers
- Multiple hidden layers
- An output layer for binary classification 1 neuron (sigmoid)

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using various metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

We also plot the confusion matrix to visually inspect the classification results.
